History
--------------------

The creation of BlitzKrieg, nicknamed “Project Flash”, began in late March of 2017, continuing into April of the same year. Its original purpose was a semester project for a Coding class, which mostly functioned as an independent study. The bot isn't yet complete, but it's still a work in progress.

BlitzKrieg was designed to work in tandem with another bot, Mod_Bot, created by another student.
Whereas Mod_Bot was designed to be a moderator bot, specializing in deleting messages and other kinds of general server upkeep, as its name would suggest, BlitzKrieg was more designed to be more “fun and games” than its developmental brother. BlitzKrieg is designed to do things directly related to the group that the creators played video games with, more specifically Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Working on BlitzKrieg has been an experience for me. I've gone through quite a bit of trial and error while writing his code. I'm just a rookie when it comes to things like Python. Stepping up to write something this big after having just been introduced to Python this same year has been quite the challenge for me. Much has been learned in the time I took to make BlitzKrieg. BlitzKrieg used to be called LmaonadeMachine, and it was an absolute hot mess of code if I've ever seen one.

Since I initially wrote the Python code for LmaonadeMachine, appropriately called lmaons.py, I learned how to make my code more crisp, clean and function properly.


Acknowledgements
--------------------
I owe a big thanks to another Git user by the name of Aurexine for helping me throughout BlitzKrieg's development process. He was hard on me at times, but that just got me more and more fired up to do it right. I hope you're proud of this, Aurexine. My being defiant of what you thought helped make BlitzKrieg a reality. Thank you for that. If you're interested in seeing things Aurexine has made for himself, his projects can be found on [his GitLab profile](https://gitlab.com/Aurexine).

In addition, I'd also like to thank another user by the name of [Ikaheishi](http://ikaheishi.net). She has been very emotionally supportive in times where I wanted to give up on the creation of BlitzKrieg, and is honestly part of the reason this bot even still exists. Not to say she didn't help me with the code directly. In fact, she even stylized this document quite a bit to give it this wonderfully pleasing organization.

My second-to-final thanks goes to my father, Jay. When I stated coding this year, he was very supportive of me. It took me some time to realize it, but he really does do what he feels is right. I never will truly see it, but people have always said we're very similar. Only now that I'm finally able to think like an adult and see things from his perspective do I understand that he tried his best when I was growing up. We're just different people. Dad, if you're reading this, which I have a feeling you will at some point, thank you for being someone I can joke around with, someone I know understands me when I ramble about code, and for being someone who nutured my new passion for coding when it first popped up. I hope I can make you proud.

My final thanks goes to my mother, Stacy. My mom is quite the character, let me tell you. She's one of the people who's kept me on my toes over the years and helped me learn that no matter how smart I think I am in a certain scenario, someone might be two or more steps ahead of me. Sure, we butt heads a lot, just like I do with my dad, but my mom taught me one of the most important lessons I've ever learned. No matter what people think of you, being yourself is the most important thing. If they don't like what you're like, who needs them? She's been there for me as an emotional outlet for a long time, has challenged me time and time again to be better than I am, and just doing a lot of small things I probably still don't even realize.


Thanks for taking the time to read this. It's a small thing, but I really do appreciate it. Enjoy using BlitzKrieg.
