History
--------------------

The creation of BlitzKrieg, nicknamed “Project Flash”, began in late March of 2017, continuing into April of the same year. Its original purpose was a semester project for a Coding class, which mostly functioned as an independent study. The bot isn't yet complete, but it's still a work in progress.

BlitzKrieg was designed to work in tandem with another bot, Mod_Bot, created by another student.
Whereas Mod_Bot was designed to be a moderator bot, specializing in deleting messages and other kinds of general server upkeep, as its name would suggest, BlitzKrieg was more designed to be more “fun and games” than its developmental brother. BlitzKrieg is designed to do things directly related to the group that the creators played video games with, more specifically Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Working on BlitzKrieg has been an experience for me. I've gone through quite a bit of trial and error while writing his code. I'm just a rookie when it comes to things like Python. Stepping up to write something this big after having just been introduced to Python this same year has been quite the challenge for me. Much has been learned in the time I took to make BlitzKrieg. BlitzKrieg used to be called LmaonadeMachine, and it was an absolute hot mess of code if I've ever seen one.

Since I initially wrote the Python code for LmaonadeMachine, appropriately called lmaons.py, I learned how to make my code more crisp, clean and function properly.

I owe a big thanks to another Git user by the name of Aurex for helping me throughout BlitzKrieg's development process. He was hard on me at times, but that just got me more and more fired up to do it right.

I hope you're proud of this, Aurex. My being defiant of what you thought helped make BlitzKrieg a reality. Thank you for that.

If you're interested in seeing things Aurex has made for himself, his projects can be found on [his GitLab profile](https://gitlab.com/Aurexine).

Thanks for taking the time to read this. It's a small thing, but I really do appreciate it. Enjoy using BlitzKrieg.
